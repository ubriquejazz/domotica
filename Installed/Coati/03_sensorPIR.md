# SENSOR DE MOVIMIENTO (PIR)

The PIR detector is designed to detect movement in an area by changes of infrared radiation levels caused for example when a person moves within the field of vision (FoV). If movement is detected a radio signal is emitted to the Coati alarm.

## Emitting the ID code

After inserting the batteries, the PIR detector needs a 60 seconds warm-up period before emitting the ID code.

- Set the Coati alarm to the "code learning" mode.
- Press the Sabotage SW for more than 3 seconds. This will emit the ID code to the Coati alarm.
