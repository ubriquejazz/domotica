## Starting up

The alarm is capable of memorizing up to 12 ID codes. For initial operation the alarm does not memorize any ID code, so its Status LED will flash every 3 seconds. It stops flashing until the code learning process has been taken place.

Upon completion of batteries insertion, the Status LED will light up for 1 second and extinguish confirming the alarma has initiated properly. Four digit security code [1 2 3 4] has been set as the default security code.

## Learning the ID code

Press 4-digit security code and then *mode key to enter to the code learning mode. Both Status and Charge LEDs will be flahing. The alarm has 30 seconds to learn the ID code from the transmitter. Once code learning is successful, the alarm will emit a long beep in response and revert to the disarm mode automatically. However if code learning has not been completed in 30 seconds, the alarm will still revert to the disarm mode automatically with the Status LED flashing 4 time rapidly. During code learning mode, any input or activation will be ignored.

## Led indication (sensor)

| LED indication | Status |
| -------------- | ------ |
| illuminating steadily | the device is emitting radio singal |
| flashing every 30 seconds| low battery |

## Cleaning out the ID codes

Press 4-digit security code and then #mode key to enter to the clearance mode. Both Status and Charge LEDs will illuminate steadly.

## Arming the alarm

**Instant mode:** arm the alarm by pressing 4-digit security code and the 1mode key. There will be 15 seconds before the alarm is armed. The delay allows you to leave the house without triggering any sensor. During this time the alarm will be beeping and the Status LED will flash. The alarm will enter to the instant arm mode after expiring the 15 seconds delay.

**Delayed mode:** arm the alarm by pressing 4-digit security code and the 2mode key. There will be 15 seconds before the alarm is armed. The delay allows you to leave the house without triggering any sensor. During this time the alarm will be beeping and the Status LED will flash. The alarm will enter to the instant arm mode after expiring the 15 seconds delay.

## Trigger

When alarm is activated it will sound 30s and be silent for 10s. Such a cycle will be repeated for 10 times. Once the alarm is activated, there won't be any sound until other 15 seconds delay. Note: set the alarm to the chimie mode when you are at home to avoid harming from frequent activation (3mode key).

## Deactivating the alarm

Disarm the alarm by pressing your 4-digit security code and then 4mode key. Any alarm activation or received radio signal will be ignored.

## Led indication (centralita)

When entering the 4-digit security code + mode key, the alarm will respond with a long beep with the Status LED iluminated. If a incorrect code is entered the Charge LED will flash and beep 3 times. Three consecutive errors will disable the keypad for 30 seconds.

Note: If input has not been entered entirely, new input doesn't ocurr after 10 seconds.
