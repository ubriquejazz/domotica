## GitHUB Actions

Here's how to automate your test in GitHub Actions using a YAML workflow. This approach will run your tests in a containerized environment whenever code is pushed to your repository.

### Prerequisites

Repository Setup: Ensure your repository contains:
- Your test script (e.g., test_firmware.py).
- A requirements.txt file for dependencies (pytest)
- A Dockerfile if you want to use Docker (optional but recommended).

### Define the GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a .github/workflows/test.yml file in your repository.
Add the following YAML configuration:

    name: Python Tests

    on:
    push:
        branches:
        - main
    pull_request:

    jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
            python-version: '3.9'

        - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt

        - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests/

### Workflow Breakdown

- Triggers (on): The workflow runs on pushes to the main branch and pull requests.
- Sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs pytest directly on the runner.
